# Non OP Torches

This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc.

The goal of this mod is to make torches less overpowered, by adding some custumizable option to debuff them. This is for those of you how donÂ´t like the option to take torches out the fire and use them with 1 match for 100% success fires.

Options include:
1) Add a breaking condition threshhold. Below this threshhold torches will break on extinguishing. If set to 50%  or above, torches form fire will never be able to bet relit just harvested for sticks. 
2) Add a Chance to fail when light a torch. The fail chance increases per missing condition point of the torch and is decreases with higher firestaring skill.
